# 📚 Track Smart — Tuition Fee Tracker App

**Track Smart** is a simple Flutter-based Android application built to help tuition teachers efficiently manage student fee records for **two batches** (B1 & B2). The app clearly separates **Paid** and **Unpaid** students, highlights overdue payments, and includes powerful tools like calling, global search, and JSON backup — all wrapped in a clean, modern UI.

> ⚡ App logic, structure, and UX design were conceived and planned by me. AI was used as an assistant for implementing the code professionally.
